*under proc import I switched around out=&url. and dbms=&url.;  as well as some other changes to see if my output would change; it didn’t change. I also changed it to filename filetype clear; instead of filename tempfile clear; I also changed it to %put Dataset &dsn. already exists. instead of %put Dataset &dsn. already exists. Please delete and try again.; and it changed the output.
